"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Make sure you use synthetic oil if possible. If you cannot get synthetic oil, use at least a blend of synthetic and conventional oil. After changing the oil, you should let the vehicle run for about 30 minutes to allow the oil to work its way throughout the system. You should notice that the noise will disappear if it was caused by an oil issue."
