"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The ability of vacuum lifting machines to move and lift heavy and large loads is a major advantage. The vacuum lifting devices can lift and move loads weighing up to several tons. They can also be used for a wide range of materials including glass, wood, sheet metal and stone."
