"text": "Momentum transfer pumps are also known as molecular or kinetic pumps. They create powerful vacuums by using a rotating part that propels gas or liquid from the vacuum side of the system to the exhaust. They convert the kinetic energy of a motor into force to force liquids or gases out of a sealed chamber."

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Hydraulic Elevators Hydraulic lifts are the safest choice because the cab never hangs inside the hoistway. Elevators with a cable-driven drive system suspend the cab in the air above the ground level. The brake system in pneumatic elevators holds the cab up at higher floors."
