"@type": "Answer",
"text": "If you are limited in space, a vacuum elevator is a good option. However, it will not be as discreet as a hydraulic lift. It is not recommended to install a pneumatic lift in confined spaces, as it will dominate the space. The monthly costs of pneumatic elevators are lower because they use less energy."

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Water lift and airflow are the two primary indicators of vacuum power performance. Water lift can be measured in mmH2O or mbar, or kPa. It is a measure of the suction force, and the standard for vacuuming heavy and liquid materials. The airflow can be measured in m3/h, or l/s."
