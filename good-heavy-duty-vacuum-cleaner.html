"text": "Check the lifter if you hear noise. If the noise is loud enough, they may hold up for some time. However, if it gets bad enough, they could break. A new lifter will suffice if you catch it early. If not, the lifter could ruin your camshaft and engine."

"text": "The term 14.7 PSIA vacuum can be used to refer to any pressure between zero PSIA (zero) and 14.7 PSIA (14,7 PSIA). It must therefore be defined. Two different approaches are used to measure vacuum pressures in this range. Vacuum pressures are measured in relation to atmospheric pressure."
