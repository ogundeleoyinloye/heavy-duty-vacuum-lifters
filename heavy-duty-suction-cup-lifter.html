It is important to note that this is a measurement of consumption, not power output... and it does not tell you anything about suction. Use a higher-wattage vacuum cleaner if you want to consume more electricity. Aug 7, 2022"

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "A sea-level engine should display a constant vacuum between 14 and 22 inches at idle speed. Between 22 in. Hg. If you open and close the throttle quickly, the vacuum should drop to below 5 inches. Then rebound to 23 inches. More than that."
